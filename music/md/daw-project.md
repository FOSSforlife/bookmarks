# DAW Project

Idea: A fully modular DAW that lets you compose, synthesize, and mix professional-quality music using code and plaintext files.

### Sound Design

- SuperCollider
- Pure Data (could use as our primary sound generation tool, with other languages that transpile to it)
  - Take a look at [Camomile VST](https://github.com/pierreguillot/Camomile)
- Helm preset JSON files

### Wavetables

- Vital
- [Hive .uhm format](https://u-he.com/downloads/manuals/plugins/hive/Hive-Wavetables.pdf)
  - Might not be possible: [See this issue in Surge repo](https://github.com/surge-synthesizer/surge/issues/815). Still good for inspiration though.
